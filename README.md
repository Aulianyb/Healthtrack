Water Intake Tracking API

## DEPENDENCIES NEEDED
- typescript
- npm
- @types/express@5.0.5
- @types/uuid@10.0.0
- express@5.1.0
- uuid@13.0.0

## HOW TO RUN
*To run this on your machine, make sure you all the dependencies needed before tunning*
1. run `npm install (this will install all the relevant packages)`
2. run `npm run dev`
3. when you see `API listening on port ${port}` on your terminal, the API is running 
4. use software such as *Postman* or *Insomnia* to use the API endpoints

## CHALLENGES I FACED
1. One of the biggest challenges is my device overheating and restarting while doing this task, cutting off a lot of my time. I recovered emailing the Action Lab team, be honest about what has happened, provide proof and continue my assignment as soon as possible. 
2. Understanding unclear instructions, creating assumptions, about the specifications needed. If i was not constricted by time limit, I would send ask for clarification from the writer of this specifications. However, since I am constricted by time, I create assumptions based on the most effective way to implement this code and my past experience of handling similar code
3. I am rushed by the timer. To handle this, I prioritize creating a working code that I can polish and optimize when I have the time. I believe that a fully working code is much better than a very optimized code that only covers half of the specification. I also prioritize the needed deliverables.
